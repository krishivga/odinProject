  <h2>Today's To Dos: 28th July, 2024</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Refactor and put all exercism (python) codes into your GitHub repo (krishivga/exercismProblems)</li>
    <li>Finish Odin Project's Foundation course. I've done most of this stuff before already tbh.</li>
    <li>Meditate for 30 minutes.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Places I'd love to visit someday.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tibet. Buddhism has always been pretty interesting, plus the landscapes adn the people are fantastic.</li>
    <li>New Zealand. Plenty of natural beauty; people describe it as out of this world. Definitely on my list.</li>
    <li>Jordan. Lots of history to be learned there, plus I've never visited any country in the middle east and that one
      is generally recommended as a starter.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Top 5 video games by playtime (steam).</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Albion Online. ~450 hours. MMO, lots of great and terrible memories.</li>
    <li>Path of Exile. ~400 hours. ARPG, absolute masterwork.</li>
    <li>Counter Strike 2. ~300 hours. Competitive FPS, one of the most polished shooter experiences ever.</li>
    <li>Dota 2. ~300 hours. MOBA, not terribly satisfying cause I was on SEA servers but it was and still is very
      addicting.</li>
    <li>Guild Wars 2. ~300 hours. Great MMO with amazing monetization and story. Combat is fun but can't say I'm a fan
      of the classes. RIP Wizard.</li>
  </ol>
