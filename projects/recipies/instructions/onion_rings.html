  <h1>Air Fried Onion Rings</h1>
  <p>These air fryer onion rings are better for you than their deep-fried counterparts! They're battered and breaded,
    then air-fried to crispy perfection.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 large onion, cut into rings</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>2 pinches garlic powder</li>
    <li>2 pinches paprika</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Stir flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Dip onion rings into the flour
      mixture until coated, then place onto a plate.</li>
    <li> Stir milk and egg into the remaining flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat.
      Place onto a wire rack until the batter stops dripping.</li>
    <li> Place bread crumbs into a shallow dish. Place rings, one at a time, into bread crumbs, scooping crumbs over the
      top until evenly coated. Give rings a hard tap as you remove them from the crumbs; the coating should cling very
      well.</li>
    <li> Heat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place rings
      into the air fryer basket so they are side-by-side without overlapping; spray lightly with cooking spray, then
      flip rings.</li>
    <li> Place the basket into the air fryer and cook until rings are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, flipping once
      halfway through. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with garlic powder and paprika.</li>
  </ol>
