  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated onion</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 (1 ounce) packet dry ranch dressing mix, divided</li>
    <li>3/4 cup mayonnaise, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed for frying</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Combine chicken, eggs, onion, parsley, mozzarella, and half of ranch seasoning packet in a large bowl. Add 1/2
      cup mayonnaise, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Stir in flour just until mixture comes together.</li>
    <li> Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C). Place a rack inside a sheet pan and set in the oven while it
      preheats. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li> Working in batches, spoon about 1/4 cup of chicken mixture into skillet for each patty. Cook, undisturbed,
      until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more. An
      instant read thermometer inserted near the center will read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Repeat with remaining
      oil and chicken mixture. Place cooked patties on the prepared pan in the oven to keep warm. </li>
    <li> Heat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place rings
      into the air fryer basket so they are side-by-side without overlapping; spray lightly with cooking spray, then
      flip rings.</li>
    <li> Combine remaining mayonnaise and remaining ranch seasoning in a small bowl. Add lemon juice and cayenne and
      stir until well combined. Serve chicken patties with ranch sauce.</li>
  </ol>
